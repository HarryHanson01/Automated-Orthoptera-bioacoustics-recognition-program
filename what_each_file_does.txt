PSD_plot.py:
- plots the power spectral density diagram of selected files

event_locater_wav_files.py:
- uses PSD to identify which files have a high enough power to be classified as an event. Splits a wav file into 3 second chunks deletes any file with a power below a specified threshold. 


chirpClassifier.py: 
 - automatically identies features of my grasshopper and cricket .wav files

Below is how each feature is determined:
  Peak Frequency (Hz): The peak frequency is determined by finding the frequency with the maximum value in the spectrogram (STFT) of the filtered audio, indicating the dominant frequency of the chirp.

  Lowest Frequency (Hz): The lowest frequency is determined by identifying the frequencies in the spectrogram that have significant energy above a threshold (5% of the maximum energy) and taking the minimum of these frequencies.

  Chirp Rate (chirps/sec): The chirp rate is calculated by detecting the peaks in the RMS energy of the filtered audio signal (indicating chirps) and dividing the total number of detected peaks by the duration of the audio in seconds. This is not accurate it is just my best attempt.

  Average Loudness (dB): The average loudness in decibels is determined by first calculating the RMS energy of the filtered audio at the chirp peaks, then converting the average RMS value to decibels using the rmsToDb() function.

  Background Noise (dB): The background noise in decibels is determined by calculating the average RMS energy of the audio signal at times where no chirps are detected (using the non-chirp indices) and converting this value to decibels. This is not accurate it is just my best attempt, it is less detecting background noise and more just telling when there is no chirping. This may be useful when determining averaging to ensure fairness as some sound files have more chirping then others.


chirpClassifierTester.py: 
- basically chirpClassifier.py but I made it to classify individual files 


FeatureVisualisation.ipynb: 
- for plotting the results of chirpClassifier.py.
- also plotting cnn results
- Also contains all the code I used to test image processing and any openCV code.
- Alot of testing done in this file

testingMLmodels.ipynb:
- for testing machine learning models on my dataset.


fileNamer.py:
- just to quickly name the files for manual data labelling

UsingTrainedModel.ipynb:
- Where I am using everything that I have tested
- used for demo

modelTraining.ipynb:
- this is where I train the model
  to train the model: 
    - import libraries
    - save and process images
    - train model
- run all the code to make the model, the files will need to be renamed to your systems needs.

GCDetector.py (and its simultaneous windows):
- this is a file made to use the model on all the data I was provided
- the simultaneous window files are to process multiple location's sounds at once
- these will produce the results as a csv file

combining_GCDetections_to_one_csv.py:
- combines each location's csv file into one
